## 1. Your first five minutes

1. Pick something from **Example:** — start with *Basic* or *Fibonacci*.
2. It assembles automatically. Press **▶ Run**.
3. Watch the **Registers** panel fill in, and the status bar report what happened.

That is the whole loop. Everything below is detail.

### The screen

```

```

- **`ASM | C`** — write RISC-V assembly, or C that is compiled for you.
- **`JS | HDL`** — run on the built-in model, or on your own Verilog processor
  ([§7](#7-running-your-own-verilog-hdl-mode)).
- **Panel chips** (Registers / Memory / Peripherals / Disassembly) show and hide panels.
  Show any combination; drag the separators to resize; click **⧉** on a panel header to
  float it. Your layout is remembered.
- **The console** under the editor carries assembler messages, `ecall` output and
  compiler errors. **Drag the bar above it** to make it taller; double-click to reset.

## 2. Writing and assembling a program

| Action | How |
|---|---|
| Load an example | **Example:** dropdown |
| Open your own file | **📂 Open** — `.asm`, `.s`, `.c`, `.h` (and `.v`, see [§7](#7-running-your-own-verilog-hdl-mode)) |
| Save your work | **💾 Save**, or `Ctrl/Cmd+S` |
| Assemble / compile | **⚙ Assemble**, or `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` |

The **Assemble** button greys out once your code is assembled and up to date, and comes
back the moment you edit. Examples and opened files assemble themselves, so **Run** and
**Step** are live immediately.

**Errors** appear in the console with a line number, and the offending line is marked in
the editor. Fix and re-assemble.

### Help while you type

- **Autocomplete** appears as you type — instructions at the start of a line, registers
  and labels in the operand positions. `Ctrl+Space` forces it open.
- A **signature tooltip** floats above the cursor showing the operand you are on
  (`PARAM 2: rs1`).
- **Hover** any mnemonic, register or label for a documentation card.
- `Ctrl/Cmd+F` / `Ctrl/Cmd+H` — find and replace.

### Writing C

Switch to **C**. The code is compiled by Compiler Explorer (Godbolt) and the resulting
assembly is what actually runs, so you can step through **C source lines** directly.
Every built-in C example ships pre-compiled, so they work with no network. Compiler,
optimisation level and ABI flags are under **⚙ Settings → Compiler**.

MMIO is available as macros: `LEDS`, `SWITCHES`, `BUTTONS`, `SEVSEG`, `UART_TX`,
`ACCEL_DATA`, `OLED_COL`, `OLED_ROW`, `OLED_DATA`, `OLED_CTRL`.

## 3. Running and debugging

| Button | Key | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| **▶ Run** / **⏸ Pause** / **▶ Resume** | `F5` | Run to the end, a breakpoint, or the instruction limit |
| **⏭ Step** | `F8` | One instruction (or one statement — see below) |
| **⏮ Back** | `Shift+F8` | Undo the last step, registers and memory included |
| **⟲ Reset** | | Back to the start, keeping the assembled program |

**Breakpoints**: click the gutter left of a line number, or press `F9`. The line number
turns red. If you pick a line with no instruction on it — a comment, a blank, a `}` —
the breakpoint **moves to the next real instruction** and the console tells you so.

**Step Back really does go back.** Registers, memory and peripheral state are all
restored; it is not a re-run from the start.

**Statement Stepping** (⚙ Settings → JS Simulation or HDL Simulation) makes one **Step**
cover a whole C statement, or a whole pseudo-instruction like `li x1, 0x12345678`,
instead of one machine instruction at a time. **Back** undoes exactly the same distance.

**A program that never ends** pauses itself after *Max Instructions Per Run*
(⚙ Settings → JS Simulation, default 100,000,000) rather than freezing the browser.

## 4. Reading the panels

### Registers

All 32 integer registers in hex and decimal. The most recently written register is
highlighted. Click a value to edit it.

### Memory

Sub-tabs `[ Code | Data | Stack | MMIO ]`, an address box and a row count.

- **Word / Byte** — one 32-bit little-endian word per cell, or separate editable bytes.
  Word is the default.
- **Code is read-only** — edit your source and re-assemble instead. Data, Stack and MMIO
  are editable: click a cell and type.
- **Stack** counts *downwards*, the way the stack actually grows.
- Orange **labels** sit above the word they name. Yellow bytes were written at runtime.
- **💾 Dump txt / 💾 Dump data** export `AA_IROM.mem` / `AA_DMEM.mem` for Vivado.

### Disassembly

What the processor actually executes, after pseudo-instructions are expanded — so
`li x1, 0x12345678` shows as the `lui` + `addi` pair it really is. The current
instruction is highlighted and scrolls into view. Label headers and jump targets
(`<loop>`) are annotated. Machine code can be shown as bytes or whole words, hex or
binary.

### Peripherals

A simulated Nexys 4 board. Everything here is live — click it while the program is
paused and the program will see the change.

| Peripheral | Address | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| LEDs / DIP switches | `0xFFFF0060` / `0xFFFF0064` | Click a switch to flip it |
| Push buttons | `0xFFFF0068` | L / C / R |
| 7-segment | `0xFFFF0080` | 32-bit value as 8 hex digits |
| UART console | `0xFFFF0000`–`0xFFFF000C` | Type in the box and press **Send** |
| OLED 96×64 | `0xFFFF0020`–`0xFFFF002C` | Colour and auto-advance modes |
| Accelerometer + temp | `0xFFFF0040` | Sliders, and Flat / Tilt / Shake presets |
| Cycle counter | `0xFFFF00A0` | Cycles since reset |

The UART box takes **ASCII** (including `\r`, `\n`, `\xHH`) or **Hex** (`0x41, 0x0D`).
Tick **Buffer** to drip-feed a long string a few instructions apart, the way a real
terminal would.

---

## 5. Settings

**⚙ Settings…** has four tabs:

| Tab | What is in it |
|---|---|
| **⚡ Compiler** | C compiler, `-O` level, `-march`/`-mabi`, M-extension toggle |
| **🗺 Linker** | Segment bases and sizes, stack top, MMIO base |
| **⏱ JS Simulation** | Statement Stepping · max instructions per run · cycles per instruction |
| **🔌 HDL Simulation** | Statement Stepping · your Verilog sources · everything for the hardware engine |

> **On a real FPGA** the RAM size is fixed in hardware. If you raise the segment sizes
> beyond what your board provides or provisioned in HDL (whichever is lower), it will work here and fail there.

## 6. Keyboard shortcuts

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `F5` | Run / Pause / Resume |
| `F8` / `Shift+F8` | Step / Step back |
| `F9` | Toggle breakpoint on the cursor's line |
| `Ctrl/Cmd+Enter` | Assemble / Compile |
| `Ctrl/Cmd+S` | Save source |
| `Ctrl+Space` | Autocomplete |
| `Ctrl/Cmd+F` / `Ctrl/Cmd+H` | Find / Replace |
| `Tab` / `Shift+Tab` | Insert a tab, or indent / dedent a selection |
| `Ctrl+Z` / `Ctrl+Y` | Undo / Redo |
| `Esc` | Close find, autocomplete or the settings dialog |

Shortcuts are suppressed while you are typing in a text box, so `F5` in the UART field
types rather than runs.

## 7. Running your own Verilog (HDL mode)

This is the part that makes the simulator a lab tool rather than a toy: the **same
program, the same breakpoints and the same board** can be driven by the processor *you*
wrote.

### Getting started

1. Click **HDL** in the toolbar. The settings dialog opens on **🔌 HDL Simulation**,
   because nothing can happen until it has your sources.
2. **Drop your `.v` files anywhere on the page** — or use **browse…**, or **📂 Open**.
   You need `Wrapper.v`, `RV.v` and *every* submodule (`ALU.v`, `Decoder.v`, `Extend.v`,
   `PC_Logic.v`, `ProgramCounter.v`, `RegFile.v`, `Shifter.v`).
   The file containing `module Wrapper` is tagged **WRAPPER** in the list.
3. Close the dialog. The chip next to `JS | HDL` should read **9 files**.
4. Assemble a program as usual, then **▶ Run**.

Your Verilog is never uploaded anywhere. It is compiled inside your browser by Icarus
Verilog, and it disappears when you close the tab — so you load it once per session.

### What is different from JS mode

- **Run becomes Resume.** It continues to the next breakpoint, or to the end of what has
  been recorded, and records another *Cycles* worth when it gets there. **⟲ Reset**
  starts the hardware over.
- **Step and Back are instant**, and Back works — a run is recorded in full, and stepping
  moves through the recording rather than re-simulating.
- **Unwritten registers show `xxxxxxxx`, not `0`.** Real hardware powers up undefined,
  and pretending otherwise would hide exactly the bugs you are looking for.
- **`Cycles` counts real clock edges** (tagged `hw`) instead of the estimate JS mode
  shows (tagged `est`).
- **Flip a switch while paused** and the run is replayed with that change stamped at the
  current cycle. Everything before that point comes out identical, so you keep your
  place — and the very next instruction already sees the new value.

### Finding a bug in your processor

Tick **Cross-check against the JS model** (⚙ Settings → 🔌 HDL Simulation). After each
run, the same program is replayed on the functional model and you are told the **first
instruction where the two disagree**, with the cycle, the PC, the instruction word and
both values. That is almost always where the RTL bug is.

### Other things in the HDL tab

| Setting | Why you would touch it |
|---|---|
| **Cycles per Run / Resume** | How much to simulate at a time. Raise it for long programs. |
| **Record the architectural trace** | On by default; needed for Step and Back. |
| **Verilog standard** | Verilog-2005 by default; switch if your code needs it. |
| **Dump a VCD waveform** | Produces a **⭳ VCD** button in the toolbar; open it in GTKWave. |
| **Register file** | Detected automatically. Type a path only if detection fails. |
| **Save testbench** | The exact generated testbench, to run in Vivado or `iverilog` offline. |

## 8. Troubleshooting

| Symptom | What is going on |
|---|---|
| **Run and Step are greyed out** | The program is not assembled. Press **⚙ Assemble**. |
| **"Breakpoint set at line X (moved from line Y)"** | You put it on a line with no instruction; it moved to the next real one. |
| **Program pauses on its own** | It hit the instruction limit — usually an infinite loop. Raise it in ⚙ Settings → JS Simulation, or find the loop. |
| **A store to memory seems ignored** | Check the address is in Data, not Code. The code segment is read-only. |
| **C code will not compile** | Godbolt needs the network. The built-in C examples work offline; your own C does not. |
| **Nothing happens in HDL mode** | Check the chip beside `JS \| HDL`. Amber means no sources, or none of them declares `module Wrapper`. |
| **HDL: compile error** | The Verilog compiler's message is in the console under the editor, with file and line. Drag the console taller if it is long. |
| **Registers all show `xxxxxxxx` in HDL mode** | Either the hardware genuinely has not written them yet, or the register file could not be found — the Registers panel says which. |
| **HDL mode is slow** | It simulates every clock edge. Reduce *Cycles*, or use JS mode for long runs. |
| **Layout has gone strange** | Use the panel chips to show or hide panels; double-click a splitter to even it out. |
